# ridvikpal/scripts

These are a collection of bash scripts I created to automate things such as backing up my files, installing programs and keeping my laptop awake when needed. For some of these scripts I created .desktop files I can symlink to my $HOME/Desktop directory, so I can quickly run them by double clicking these files on my desktop.

Please note that I use Debian (Stable) Linux and so some commands may not be consistent across other *nix flavours and distributions. Feel free to copy these and modify them to your needs!
